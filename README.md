# Capstone

## Phase 3 Notes:
Most of the changes made in phase 3 are contained in the cart.php file. I scrapped an early attempt at a product page which is now in my dump folder. My original deliverable said "Gallery displays database info" but I really just meant that the website can display information from the database anywhere so I think I still completed the deliverable. Shopping cart has some issues. Can only add one card id at a time. 

Deliverables for Phase 3 were: 
- [x] Database populated with card data
- [x] Gallery displays database info (altered to Checkout displays database info)
- [x] Shopping Cart Created
- [x] Items can be added to cart
- [x] Code polish (changed some style issues)
