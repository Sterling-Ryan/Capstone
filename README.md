# Capstone

## Phase 2 Notes:
The dump folder contains my attempts at creating login forms to show the database connection. My GitHub pages link no longer works since I changed my index page to php. Most of the work for phase two can be found in the login folder and in index.php

Deliverables for Phase 3 were: 
- [x] Database populated with card data
- [x] Gallery displays database info (altered to Checkout displays database info)
- [x] Shopping Cart Created
- [x] Items can be added to cart
- [x] Code polish (changed some style issues)
