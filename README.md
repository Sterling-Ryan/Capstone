# Capstone

##Phase 2 Notes:
The dump folder contains my attempts at creating login forms to show the database connection. My GitHub pages link no longer works since I changed my index page to php. Most of the work for phase two can be found in the login folder and in index.php

Deliverables for Phase 2 were: 
- [x] Research Database Creation
- [x] Research Databse Integration
- [x] Create Database
- [x] Create Table for users
- [x] Create Table for cards
- [x] Establish Database Connection to Website
